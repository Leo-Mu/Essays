I have a keen interest and independent study in IT and science, specifically modern physics, deep learning and blockchain. Since a child, I have fallen in love with science and technology. So I read lots of magazines and books, such as Glencoe science series. And I enrolled in some MOOCs on Coursera and Xuetangx. I love programing. I joined a technology innovation project as programer. I served as Deputy Director of the school TV Station. I'm holding several blockchain assets. I believe physics and IT have special meaning for human civilization. Physics is the king of the natural science. According to the first principle, all natural science problems can be converted to physical questions. IT is the most powerful tool which human ever invented. So I hope to learn them more professionally in Southern University of Science and Technology, SUSTech.
