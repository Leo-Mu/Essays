## JUST HOW ARE YOU INTELLIGENT?

### Describe eight criteria that Gardner developed to identify intelligences.

An intelligence 'modality' must fulfill eight criteria:

- potential for brain isolation by brain damage
- place in evolutionary history
- presence of core operations
- susceptibility to encoding (symbolic expression)
- a distinct developmental progression
- the existence of savants, prodigies and other exceptional people
- support from experimental psychology
- support from psychometric findings

### How many intelligences do we have according to Gardnerâ€™s theory? Please list them.

Gardner proposed eight abilities that he held to meet these criteria at first:

- musical-rhythmic,
- visual-spatial,
- verbal-linguistic,
- logical-mathematical,
- bodily-kinesthetic,
- interpersonal,
- intrapersonal,
- naturalistic

He later suggested that existential and moral intelligences may also be worthy of inclusion.

### Describe Interpersonal Intelligence.

Interpersonal Intelligence as known as social skills. In theory, individuals who have high interpersonal intelligence are characterized by their sensitivity to others' moods, feelings, temperaments, motivations, and their ability to cooperate in order to work as part of a group.  Those with high interpersonal intelligence communicate effectively and empathize easily with others, and may be either leaders or followers. They often enjoy discussion and debate. Gardner has equated this with emotional intelligence of Goleman.

Gardner believes that careers that suit those with high interpersonal intelligence include sales persons, politicians, managers, teachers, lecturers, counselors and social workers.

## MAPS IN YOUR MIND

### Describe two mainmodifications which Tolman proposed to the prevailing view

The first proposal made was that the true nature and complexity oflearning could not be fully understood without an examination of the internal mental processes that accompanythe observable stimuli and responses.

The second proposal made was that even though internal cognitive processes could not be directly observed, cognitive maps could be objectively and scientifically inferred from observable behavior.

### Describe the Figure 1.

It's result of the latent learning experiment. For this study, rats were divided into three groups.Croup C, the control group, was exposed to a complex maze using the standard procedure of one run through the maze each day with a food reward at the end of the maze. Croup N (no reward) was exposed to the maze for the same amount of time each day but found no food and received no reward for any behavior in the maze. Croup D (delayed reward) was treated exactly like group N for the first 10 days of the study, but then on day 11 found food at the end of the maze and continued to find it each day thereafter. Figure 1 summarizes the results for the three groups based on the average number of errors (running down blind alleys) made by each group of rats.

In the graph, the rats in groups N and D did not learn much of anything about the maze when they were not receiving any reward for running through the maze. The control rats learned the maze to near-perfection in about two weeks. However, when the rats in group D discovered a reason to run the maze, they learned it to near-perfection in only about three days (day 11 to day 13). The only possible explanation for these findings was that during those 10 days when the rats were wandering around in the maze, they were learning much more about the maze than they were showing.

### Describe five categories of environmental features which Lynch proposed that we make use of in forming our cognitive maps.

Lynch proposed five categories of environmental features that we make use of in forming our cognitive maps.

- Paths. Perceived arteries that carry traffic, whether it be in cars, on foot, on bicycles, or in boats.
- Edges. Boundaries we use in our cognitive mapping to divide one area from another, but do not function as paths, such as a canyon, a wall, or the shore of a lake.
- Nodes. Focal points, such as city parks, traffic, circles, or a fountain, where paths or edges meet.
- Districts. Large spaces on our mental representations and defined by some common characteristic, such as the theater district or restaurant row.
- landmarks are structures. We use as points of reference within your map and that are usually visible from a distance. Examples of these would be a clock tower, a church steeple, or a tall or especially unusual building.

## THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES!

### What did Loftus hypothesize?

Loftus hypothesized that if eyewitnesses are asked questions that contain a false presupposition about the witnessed event, the new false information may be incorporated into the witness's memory of the event and appear subsequently in new testimony by the witness.

### Briefly describe the method and results of experiment 2

Method:
For this study, 40 subjects were shown a film clip, which showed a class being disrupted by eight demonstrators. Then the subjects were given questionnaires containing 20 questions relating to the film clip. For half of the subjects, one of the questions asked, "Was the leader of the four demonstrators who entered the classroom a male?" For the other half, the question asked, "Was the leader of the 12 demonstrators who entered the classroom a male?" One week after, the subjects from both groups returned and answered 20 new questions about the film. The one question that provided the results of the study was, "How many demonstrators did you see entering the classroom?"

Results:
The group that had received the question presupposing 12 demonstrators reported seeing an average of 8.85. Those who had received the question asking about 4 demonstrators averaged 6.40. This was a significant difference. This experiment showed that, on average, the wording of one question altered the way subjects remembered the basic characteristics of a witnessed event.

###  What is Loftus's theory of why many eyewitness testimonies are incorrect?

Loftus argued that an accurate theory of memory and recall must include a process of reconstruction that occurs when new information is integrated into the original memory of an event. The findings of these studies cannot be explained by assuming that recall simply involves a mental replaying of an event, even with varying degrees of accuracy. The extra step of integrating new information into memory has been added. This new information, in turn, causes your representation of the original memory to be altered or reconstructed. Later, if you are asked a question about the event, your recall will not be of the actual original event, but of your reconstruction of it.  The false presupposition in the questions, provided a subtle form of new information that was unintentionally integrated into the original memory of the event.

In applying this idea to eyewitnesses in criminal investigations, Loftus pointed out that often witnesses are questioned more than once.  During these various sessions of questions, it is not unlikely that false presuppositions will be made, probably unintentionally. There are innumerable ways in which this might happen. Common, innocent-sounding questions such as "What did the guy's gun look like?" or "Where was the get-away car parked?" have been shown to increase the chances that witnesses will remember a gun or a getaway car whether or not they were actually there. So, while the attorneys, the judge, and the jury are making the assumption that the witness is re-creating what was actually seen, Loftus contends that what is being remembered by the witness is a "regenerated image based on the altered memorial representation".
