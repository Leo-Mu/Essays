[TOC]

## Definition

The term unisex public toilets, also called gender-inclusive, gender-neutral and mixed-sex or all-gender toilets, bathrooms or restrooms, refers to public toilets that are not separated by gender or sex. Unisex public toilets can benefit a range of people with or without special needs, for example people with disabilities, the elderly, and anyone who needs the help of someone of another gender or sex. They are also valuable for parents wishing to accompany one or more of their young children needing a toilet facility.

### Building regulations in the United Kingdom

[Part M. Access to and use of buildings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_regulations_in_the_United_Kingdom#Part_M._Access_to_and_use_of_buildings)

Part M requires the inclusive provision of ease of access to and circulation within all buildings, together with requirements for facilities for disabled people.

Buildings should have reasonable provision:

- For all people to gain access and use the building.
- **Toilets provision shall be made available for all.**
- If a building has seating such as audience or spectator seating, reasonable provision should be made for people with disabilities.

### Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) regulations in the United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 requires businesses to provide toilets for their employees, along with washing facilities including soap or other suitable means of cleaning. The [Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Approved Code of Practice and Guidance L24](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pUbns/priced/l24.pdf), available from Health and Safety Executive Books, outlines guidance on the number of toilets to provide and the type of washing facilities associated with them.

#### Requirements under these Regulations
Employers have a duty under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of their employees at work. People in control of non-domestic premises have a duty towards people who are not their employees but use their premises. The Regulations expand on these duties and are intended to protect the health and safety of everyone in the workplace, and ensure that adequate welfare facilities are provided for people at work.

Several of the regulations require things to be ‘suitable’. Regulation 2(3) makes it clear that things should be suitable for anyone. This includes people with disabilities. Where necessary, parts of the workplace, particularly doors, passageways, stairs, showers, washbasins, toilets and workstations, should be made accessible for disabled people.

#### Minimum numbers of facilities

Table 1 shows the minimum number of toilets and washbasins that should be provided where both men and women are working. Column 1 refers to the maximum number of workers likely to be in the workplace at any one time. If separate toilets are provided for a group of workers (eg men, women, office workers or manual workers), a separate calculation should be made for each group. More facilities may be necessary if, for example, breaks are taken at set times or workers finish work together and need to wash before leaving.

Table 1 Number of facilities needed per number of people at work

Number of people at work | Number of cubicles | Number of washbasins
-------------------------|--------------------|---------------------
1 to 5                   | 1                  | 1
6 to 25                  | 2                  | 2
26 to 50                 | 3                  | 3
51 to 75                 | 4                  | 4
76 to 100                | 5                  | 5

Table 1 provides advice on provision for mixed workplaces. However, where it may be necessary to provide urinals for use by men, then the advice in Table 2 may be followed.

Table 2 may be followed as an alternative to column 2 of Table 1 if toilets are only used by men. A urinal may either be an individual urinal or a section of urinal space which is at least 600 mm long.

Table 2 Number of facilities needed per number of men at work

Number of men at work | Number of cubicles | Number of urinals
----------------------|--------------------|------------------
1 to 15               | 1                  | 1
16 to 30              | 2                  | 1
31 to 45              | 2                  | 2
46 to 60              | 3                  | 2
61 to 75              | 3                  | 3
76 to 90              | 4                  | 3
91 to 100             | 4                  | 4

### Guide for planning unisex bathroom from a washroom accessories company Washware Essentials

[Planning A Unisex Bathroom: The Pros, Cons & Practicalities](https://www.washwareessentials.co.uk/content/unisex-bathroom)

A unisex bathroom will obviously need to be larger than a single sex bathroom in order to accommodate users of both genders. While there are no hard and fast rules about how large a washroom should be, the Health and Safety Executive has issued guidance on the number of toilets and washbasins that should be provided per person in a mixed use bathroom:

Number of people | Number of toilets | Number of washbasins
-----------------|-------------------|---------------------
1-5              | 1                 | 1
6-25             | 2                 | 2
26-50            | 3                 | 3
51-75            | 4                 | 4
76-100           | 5                 | 5

This should help you figure out the required dimensions for your washroom. The recommended dimensions of each individual toilet cubicle are set out in the Building Regulations Part M. The building regulations also dictate that when four or more cubicles are provided in a washroom, one of them must be an enlarged cubicle for disabled users. You may also wish to provide baby changing facilities if appropriate.

Since all toilet cubicles will cater for women, you should provide a sanitary towel waste bin in each stall. We also sell recessed designs that can be mounted into a wall, which will help save space.

For privacy reasons, it might seem like a good idea to rule out urinals altogether; however, installing them in your unisex washroom would reduce waiting times for female users, and also help minimise the risk of pee on the toilet seats. Bowl urinals afford greater privacy, but troughs urinals are cheaper and take up less space. You could install a modesty screen between each urinal to further enhance privacy, or you could go one further and install your urinals in a separate section of the washroom, obscured from view behind a partial wall.

The extra room afforded by a mixed use washrooms means that you could consider installing a stylish freestanding hand wash fountain instead of individual hand-washing basins. You also have the option of a communal trough sink if you wish to bring costs down further.

## Development

### Legislation and country examples

#### Canada
In April 2014, the Vancouver Park Board decided to install unisex toilets in public buildings, with different signs to identify them. Amongst the options discussed was the rainbow triangle (based on the pink triangle used during the Holocaust), an "all-inclusive" gender symbol, an icon representing a toilet or the phrases "washroom" or "gender-neutral washroom" placed on the entrances to the toilets. According to Global News, a Canadian online newspaper, many different regions across Canada offer unisex toilets and other gender-neutral facilities, but Vancouver was the first municipality to change building codes to require unisex toilets be built in public buildings. This movement, according to commissioner Trevor Loke, was aimed to make everyone feel welcomed and included: "We think that the recommendation of universal washrooms is a good idea [...] [w]e will be using more inclusive language based on the BC Human Rights Code." Some initiatives to make public toilets more diverse and inclusive have focused on language simply by using the phrases "toilet" or "gender-neutral toilet" in order to be inclusive of all genders and gender identities, or using specifically geared language such as "women and trans women" as opposed to just "women" (and vice versa for men and trans men).

#### China
Unisex toilets have appeared in China since before 2013 in Shenyang and Chengdu by 2015. However, it was not until November 19, 2016 that Shanghai China opened its first public unisex toilet near the Zhangjiabin River in a park, in the Pudong district.[citation needed] Many of these toilets have opened in high-traffic areas for the convenience of users as opposed to existing for the benefit of those in need of a unisex toilet, for example sexual minorities or those who are disabled. In May 2016 a Beijing- based non-governmental organization launched an 'All Gender Toilets' campaign to bring awareness to this issue in China. This resulted in around 30 locations opening unisex public toilets.

#### India
In 2014 the Indian Supreme Court gave transgender people, also known as 'hijras', recognition with a third gender. This legislation included creating separate toilets for transgender people in public spaces where transgender people are often met with violence and hostility. The two-judge Supreme Court bench was led by Justice KS Radhakrishnan, who said, "The court order gives legal sanctity to the third gender. The judges said the government must make sure that they have access to medical care and other facilities like separate wards in hospitals and separate toilets". In 2017 The Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation sent out guidelines to the Swachh Bharat Mission decreeing that members who are part of the transgender community should be allowed to use the public toilet they are most comfortable with.

The central government has allowed transgender persons to use the toilets of their choice in public and community toilets. However, this may not automatically ensure safety from violence.

#### Japan
As of 2016, no laws were in place regarding the usage of public toilets in relation to gender identity. There may, however, be occasional signs outside public toilets to indicate that the stall is "gender free". The Tokyo city government is planning to install one unisex toilet in at least seven out of eleven of the buildings being used for the Olympic Games in 2020.

#### Nepal
LGBT rights in Nepal have existed for a number of years but it wasn't until Sunil Babu Pant who was elected into Parliament, used part of the Parliamentarian Development Fund to build the first two unisex toilets in Nepalganj, one of which is in Bageshwori Park. Starting in 2014 The Nepal Country Report, A Participatory Review and Analysis of the Legal and Social Environment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Persons and Civil Society recommended that in schools separate toilets or unisex toilets should be built for transgender students.

#### Thailand
The term "kathoeys" used to describe effeminate male-bodied people, for whom schools have started opening sex-separated toilets for since 2003. After legislation passed, in 2004 a private vocational college in Chiang Mai Thailand gave 15 'kathoey' students the opportunity to use toilet facilities that were solely for them, referred to as 'pink lotus' public toilets. Alliance organizations in Thailand such as the Thai Transgender Alliance and the Transferral Association of Thailand were created to support kathoey people such as by helping create separate public toilet facilities.

#### United States
Main article: Bathroom bill
There are unisex toilets in some public spaces in the United States. Despite this, transgender and non-conforming gendered people are still sometimes subject to visual or verbal scrutiny; this is reinforced by the architectural design and heteronormative gendered codes of conduct that are still present within the US.

On the federal level, the U.S. Department of Labor is in charge of workplace toilets, which means setting state guidelines through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). For non-work related public toilet guidelines, the Department of Health and Human Services governs regulations. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") has also played a role in interpreting federal statutes and enforcing them. Two statutes relevant to public toilets are Title VII (nondiscrimination in the workplace) and Title IX (nondiscrimination in educational opportunity based on sex).

Building codes may be adopted by statute or regulation. They may require sex-separation or they may require unisex toilets. New building codes usually do not apply retroactively. Thus, building owners may choose not to update existing features because it allows them to continue following the older building codes that govern those older features. These regulations are mostly based on the precedent created by original legislation. They sometimes also work to eliminate the longer wait time females often face by creating a ratio of more female toilets than male toilets.

##### US local ordinances

In most jurisdictions, local governments have the ability to pass ordinances, so long as they do not conflict with state law. Cities of San Francisco (CA), Philadelphia (PA), Seattle (WA), Washington (DC), West Hollywood (CA), Austin (TX), Cleveland (OH), New York City (NY), Philadelphia (PA), Washington D.C. and the US states of Vermont, New Mexico, Illinois, and California - have passed measures mandating that single-occupancy toilets in public spaces be labeled as unisex (or gender-neutral).

Two examples for local ordinances regarding unisex public toilets (more examples and information is available in bathroom bill):

The City Council of Portland, Oregon passed an ordinance for "all user restrooms" in 2015. This ordinance directed all city bureaus to convert all "single-user gender-specific restrooms" into "all-user restrooms" within six months.
On May 11, 2018, the US state of Vermont Gov. Phil Scott signed a bill requiring all single-user public toilets to be unisex - effective from July 1, 2018.
The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group, recommends that employers grant access, and use, to public toilets according to an employee's "full time gender presentation", and provides a list of recommendations for employers on how to do so.
